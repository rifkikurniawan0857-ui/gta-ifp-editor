# GTA SA IFP Editor - GitHub Actions Build

Since the Google Colab approach has been failing, this repository provides an alternative method to build the APK using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account (free to create at https://github.com)

## How to Build the APK

1. Fork this repository or create a new repository and upload all these files
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
3. The build workflow will automatically start
4. Wait for about 30-45 minutes for the build to complete
5. Once completed, you can download the APK from the "Artifacts" section

## Files in This Repository

- `main.py`: The main application code using Kivy
- `buildozer.spec`: Configuration file for building the Android APK
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the APK

## Troubleshooting

If the build fails:
1. Check the build logs in the Actions tab
2. Make sure all files are uploaded correctly
3. Ensure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory

## Benefits of Using GitHub Actions

- Free to use
- No need for a powerful computer
- Consistent build environment
- No dependency on Colab's unstable environment
